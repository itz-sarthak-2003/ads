Within this repository, I have developed a Library Management System that utilizes both arrays and singly linked lists. I have implemented methods including accept(), display(), search(), update(), and Delete() for managing book records.

Below is a brief overview of the methods:

    accept(): This method allows for the addition of new book records to the system.
    display(): This method enables the display of all existing book records within the system.
    search(): This method facilitates searching for specific books within the system based on their attributes.
    update(): This method allows for the modification of existing book records within the system.
    Delete(): This method enables the deletion of specific book records from the system.

Both arrays and singly linked lists are utilized to efficiently manage and manipulate the book records within the system. The implementation ensures proper memory management and data organization for effective library management operations.
